## Description

In this week's challenge, we had to create a daily scheduler that showed the current date and time blocks for a 9-5 day. We utilized dayjs(), local storage, and other JavaScript concepts.

## Usage

To use this daily planner, you type an event that you need to remember and hit the blue save button at the end of the time block. When you refresh the page you will be able to see the event persist on the page. The event will also be stored in local storage. The time blocks are color coded. Green is for future time hour, red is for the current time hour, and gray is in the past.
